# perceptron
This is a very very simple perceptron that learns a number. The is no bias parameter.

This code is very simple as it just takes a number a input. The weight is initialized to 0.01. This is a simple $\theta$ X, equation of a line passing by the origin.
<br />
The output as you change 'num_to_learn' is funny. 
If 'num_to_learn' = 0, theta = [0.01414049, 0.01]<br />
If 'num_to_learn' = 1, theta = [0.999999 0.009999] 

<br />

We can see that a perceptron is linear combination of its input. The activation function is just the identity.
